            <p>
                Hello! My name is Jazmin Green and I am a junior Computer Science major at North Carolina Agricultural & Technical State University. I like playing video games, going hiking, knitting, and reading on my free time. My family are currently living in Concord, NC. I have a cat named Yuki and 2 older sisters as well.
                I want to develop my coding skills to profficiency and hopefully in the future, work in video game design. I also have an interest in computer system development. A&T has made a great home for furthering my education and connecting with other students in my field. 
            </p>
